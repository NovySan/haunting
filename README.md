## Required Images

### Main Map (love-library-map.png)
- **Required**: This is the primary map that shows all 9 haunting locations
- Should clearly mark each location with numbers 1-9
- Can be a floor plan, architectural drawing, or stylized map
- Recommended size: 1200x800px or similar aspect ratio

### Optional Detail Images
- You can add individual detail images for each location
- These could be close-up maps, photographs, or clue images
- Name them `location-[number]-detail.png`

## The Nine Locations (for your map)

1. **Archives (Basement)** - Cold spots, books rearranging
2. **Stack Level 3 South** - Shadow figures between shelves  
3. **Heritage Room** - EVP hotspot, whispers recorded
4. **Link Gallery** - Equipment malfunction zone
5. **Stack Level 5 North** - Time distortion reported
6. **Adele Hall Learning Commons** - Phantom footsteps after midnight
7. **Special Collections** - Books open to specific pages
8. **Stack Level 2 East** - The Pattern first discovered here
9. **Service Tunnel Access** - DO NOT ENTER ALONE

## ARG Gameplay Flow

Players should:
1. Visit the website to read the investigation files
2. Use the map to locate all 9 haunting sites in Love Library
3. Visit each physical location in sequence
4. Look for clues or QR codes you've placed at each location
5. Discover "The Pattern" by connecting the locations
6. Unlock the mystery of the tenth location

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload `index.html` and the `images/` folder
3. Go to Settings → Pages
4. Under "Source," select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch and "/" (root) folder
6. Click Save
7. Your site will be live at: `https://[your-username].github.io/[repo-name]/`

## Customization Ideas

### Adding QR Codes at Physical Locations
- Create QR codes that link to hidden pages
- Each QR could reveal additional story fragments
- Consider password-protecting certain content

### Interactive Elements You Could Add
- A submission form for players to report findings
- Hidden pages that unlock with passwords
- Audio files (EVP recordings) 
- Video content (security camera footage)
- A countdown timer to create urgency

### Enhancing the Map
- Make it interactive with clickable hotspots
- Add a "completion tracker" that shows which locations have been visited
- Include cryptic symbols or patterns that become important later

## Story Synopsis

Three UNL paranormal researchers investigated Love Library after hours on October 27, 2025. They discovered nine locations with anomalous activity. As they investigated each location in sequence, they unknowingly traced out "The Pattern" - a dimensional cataloging system that archived them into the library's permanent collection. Players must follow their path to uncover the truth, but risk becoming part of the collection themselves.

## Safety Note for Players

Since this is an ARG taking place in a real location:
- Ensure players only access publicly accessible areas
- Include operating hours for Love Library
- Add disclaimers about respecting the actual library space
- Consider coordinating with library staff if the ARG gains popularity

*Remember: The Pattern is watching. Every page turned, every shelf browsed, every book opened - it all feeds the archive.*
